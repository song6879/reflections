When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    There are a couple of occasions that I want to use a remote repository, such as 
    when several people work on a same project, when I want to share my own code with 
    others, when I want to backup my work in case my own computer collapse.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If having Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote repository, then
    there may have conflicts between local version and remote version. Fox example,
    someone in your team has a commit while you are working on the same file, if
    automatically updating, it's not at the right time, and the conflicts are not
    easy to resolve, it's better manually updating, let you decide when to pull 
    remote repository.
